Hello!
I'm tablet thing friend guy!
I'm an example for the speech system in this game.
This is a demo showing how different characters can talk or narrate using different dialogue text files.
A scene can have many characters with different dialogues, this system allows you to create scripts for specific scenes or characters and add music/narration or other context dependent actions to the scene.
Bye!
